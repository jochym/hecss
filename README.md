# HECSS

## High Efficiency Configuration Space Sampler

This is a Markow-Chain Metropolis-Hastings configuration space sampler.

The main sampler is in the `hecss.py` module. The calculation monitoring
functions are in the `calc_monitor.py` module. The examples are in:

* `run_sampler.py` - jupyter notebook with full sampler run example
* `monitor_stats.py` - sampling statistics notebook
* `monitor_phonons.py` - phonon convergence monitoring notebook
* `example` - directory with input data files with 3C-SiC 2x2x2 supercell

The notebooks should be opened with `open as -> notebook` in JupyterLab.
