    ">At the moment the HECSS sampler supports only VASP and ASAP3/OpenKIM calculators. However, it is explicitly written in such a way that it should be quite easy to extend it to other calculators (e.g. QE, AbInit). The VASP and ASAP calculators are simply the only ones tested so far. The following instructions cover only VASP. Contributions extending support to other calculators are welcomed and will be included in the distribution."

    "## Install\n",
    "\n",
    "The HECSS package is available on pypi and conda-forge additionally the package is present also in my personal anaconda channel (jochym). Installation is simple, but requires a number of other packages to be installed as well. Package managers handle these dependencies automatically. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Install with pip\n",
    "It is advisable to install in a dedicated virtual environment e.g.:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python3 -m venv venv\n",
    ". venv/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "then install with `pip`:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install hecss\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install with conda\n",
    "Also installation with conda should be performed for dedicated or some other non-base environment. To create dedicated environment you can invoke `conda create`:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create -n hecss -c conda-forge hecss\n",
    "```\n",
    "or you can install in some working environment `venv`:\n",

    "\n",
    "The example data is not distributed within the library package. However, when you learn the software it is usefull to have some pre-calculated results and template configs to have a starting point. The `example` directory in the source distribution contains template configuration files for a calculation (`VASP_3C-SiC` subdirectory) and the example data calculated for the same systems (`VASP_3C-SiC_calculated` subdirectory).\n",
    "As the name suggests these are 1x1x1 and 2x2x2 supercells of the 3C-SiC (cubic silicon carbide) calculated with VASP DFT calculator.\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain the data you need to download the zip archive from the source repository: [hecss-examples.zip](https://gitlab.com/jochym/hecss/-/archive/master/hecss-master.zip?path=example) \n",
    "\n",
    "The source is published at the [Gitlab hecss repository](https://gitlab.com/jochym/hecss). \n",

    "```bash\n",
    "git clone https://gitlab.com/jochym/hecss.git\n",

    "To use HECSS you need some code for calculation of energies and forces in the form of ASE calculator. At this moment two calculators are supported: ASAP/LAMMPS/OpenKIM and VASP. The first is a free, fast, effective potential calculator which can be used for testing and experimentation. It is also used in HECSS test suite. VASP is a non-free, high quality, academic DFT code which you can use for research-grade calculations. Other calculators are available in ASE (abInit, gpaw and many others). There is no reason for other ASE calculators to not work with HECSS, these two are just supported and tested for now. The next in line will be probably abInit - since this is also a high-quality, research-grade DFT code which happen to be also free."
