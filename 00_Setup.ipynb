However, it is explicitly written in such a way that it should be quite easy to extend it to other calculators (e.g. QE, AbInit). The VASP and ASAP calculators are simply the only ones tested so far. The following instructions cover only VASP. Contributions extending support to other calculators are welcomed and will be included in the distribution."
